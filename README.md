# photoglitcher

browses www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper+wallpapers for pictures, makes multiple copies, inserts random datas into photo to glitch it.

most results aren't very good. photos seem to break depending on their format. png seems best, jpg is second best.
inspired by http://magazine.art21.org/2011/09/20/how-to-use-python-to-create-a-simple-flickr-photo-glitcher/ after it refused to work.
